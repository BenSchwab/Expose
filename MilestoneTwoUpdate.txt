Milestone Two:

We have created the basic front end logic for expose. This includes recording what the user types, and creating javascript objects
which represent the E/R graph that we base or translation from.

You can test the current version by openining index.html in a folder with all the other files we submitted in Chrome. This version
uses a partial parser which can understand select from where claues with only one where filter. It also naively naturally joins
tables as it encounters them. A lot of work is left, but we believe this framework will be able to be extended for our more complete
final version.

We also have a separate, and more complete grammar and parser that we will intergrate into the UI.

Work to be done:
We still need to specify the endpoint we will call in order to execute the sql queries we are generating. We also need to be
able to display the results of the queries in real time in the front end.
